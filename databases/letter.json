  "A": "This is very powerful as the first letter of a name. A people are their own person—they’re sure of themselves and ambitious. Original and creative, they tend to like their own ideas best. Sometimes an indicator of an impulsive individual, A as the first letter also indicates a natural leader who likes action and plenty of it. No grass grows under their feet!",
  "B": "B people are prone to sensitivity and must be careful to not take things personally. Wanting to keep the peace, they sometimes acquiesce to others. To be happy, B people need togetherness and companionship. Also drawn to collecting, these people may have treasures displayed or tucked away"
